# bigjobs
Jobs triggering library
Very simple Jobs Orchestrating API.


At the moment the project is a POC and a work in progress.

The project purpose is to manage easily different type of jobs by defining triggers in a very simple way.
The need arose by trying to launch two bigquery jobs (GCP) one after the other.


The use of this library is not recommended at this stage of development.
